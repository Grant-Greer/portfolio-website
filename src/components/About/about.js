        I'm a Portland, Oregon based Front-end Software Developer. I have made a
        career of turning designs and PSDs into well-crafted websites. Iâ€™m
        comfortable working on both the back-end and front-end of a website, but
        I tend to spend more time working on the front-end. I have a passion for
        user experience, and I enjoy working on projects that improve the web in
        some way.
